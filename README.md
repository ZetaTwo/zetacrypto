# Zeta Two's Crypto library

Build status: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ZetaTwo/zetacrypto.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ZetaTwo/zetacrypto)

This is a library for performing cryptoanalysis and other things related to cryptography.
Any ciphers implemented in this library should not be used for production code.
For that you should use proper cryptographic libraries.

This library is being developed as a part of solving the [Matasano crypto challenges](http://cryptopals.com).
